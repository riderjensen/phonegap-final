      <div data-role="collapsible">
        <h4>Druid</h4>
        <p>Druids are versatile hybrids. They perform different roles using appropriate shape-shifting forms. They can
          have high armor and rage like a warrior in Bear Form, stealth and fight in melee like a rogue in Cat Form, or
          heal and nuke with spells in humanoid form. Through talents, they can enhance one or more of these roles and
          even gain a new form for nuking (Moonkin Form). Their talent trees are Balance, for nuking, Feral, for melee
          damage and tanking capabilities, and lastly, Restoration, for healing. With roughly equivalent gear, talents
          appropriate to the role, and in the hands of a skilled player, they can be just as effective as one of the
          classes dedicated to each role.</p>
      </div>
      <div data-role="collapsible">
        <h4>Hunter</h4>
        <p>Hunters are the only class that can effectively use ranged weapons (bows, guns, or crossbows) as a primary
          source of damage. Very adept at kiting, they have plenty of tools to allow them to avoid melee combat, which
          is not where their strength lies. Hunters may tame many varieties of beasts to serve as combat pets, which
          along with an array of scouting, tracking, and survival abilities make them excellent solo characters. The
          three talent specializations for hunters are Marksmanship, Beast Mastery, and Survival.</p>
      </div>
      <div data-role="collapsible">
        <h4>Mage</h4>
        <p>Mages are ranged magic damage dealers with very powerful direct and area of effect damage spells, but in
          return have weak armor and defense. Mages also feature a variety of utility spells, such as teleportation or
          the creation of portals to captial cities. The also feature the popular crowd control ability, Polymorph, and
          can even conjure food and water. Because of their various spells which include burst damage, they are often
          effective at PvP regardless of their low armor.</p>
      </div>
      <div data-role="collapsible">
        <h4>Paladin</h4>
        <p>Paladins are Holy warriors and are a hybrid class. They can deal melee DPS, tank, or heal. Paladins also have
          very strong group support and buff abilities, arguably one of the best buffing and group support classes in
          the game. They can wear heavy plate armor and carry shields, but are also efficient single target healers,
          which combine to produce their renowned durability in combat. With talent specialization and equipment
          selection, Paladins can fill the role of melee DPS, tank, offtank, or healer and excel when called upon to
          spot-fill all these roles in a group setting.</p>
      </div>
      <div data-role="collapsible">
        <h4>Priest</h4>
        <p>Priests are arguably the most versatile healing class in the game. Priests can be powerful in healing a
          single character or many allies at once. Priests have a variety of utility spells, along with a few tricks,
          such as Mind Control and the extremely useful Dispel Magic and Cure Disease.</p>
      </div>
      <div data-role="collapsible">
        <h4>Rogue</h4>
        <p>Rogues excel at dealing melee damage and incapacitating their foes, particularly low health and low armor
          targets such as casters. Stealth gives them a tactical advantage and allows them to start a fight on their own
          terms. Other important abilities include lockpicking and the handling of poisons. Another perk of the rogue is
          their ability to stun and incapacitate a hostile target for a long period of time.</p>
      </div>
      <div data-role="collapsible">
        <h4>Shaman</h4>
        <p>Shamans are one of the most versatile classes in the game as they can switch seamlessly from offensive caster
          to healer to melee DPS as needed, though at later levels they often specialize in one of these roles. Shamans
          can provide good support to a party, with the ability to step in and fill any role that may be lacking at the
          moment. Their high burst damage and healing also make them quite good at PvP.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div data-role="collapsible">
        <h4>Warlock</h4>
        <p>Warlocks enslave demons and call upon dark magic and curses to dominate and destroy their foes. Like hunters,
          warlocks employ combat pets, but these are summoned demons rather than tamed beasts. They are primarily ranged
          magic damage dealers with a focus on dealing "damage over time" in addition to nukes and AoE, but lack the
          extreme burst damage capabilities of a mage.</p>
      </div>
      <div data-role="collapsible">
        <h4>Warrior</h4>
        <p>Warriors are close-combat, melee fighters and usually fill the role of primary tank or off-tank, as they are
          able to both withstand and inflict fierce physical punishment. Warriors have the most versatile means of
          generating threat and keeping aggro off other characters. They can also contribute very strong melee DPS when
          needed. Warrior abilities use rage, which is generated by dealing and taking damage, but decays over time
          while not in combat.</p>
